### Behavior Driven Development
A user can:

1. Choose the size of pizza they want e.g Small, Medium, Large
2. Choose what kind of crust they would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free
3. Choose the topping(s) they want on my pizza.
4. Place an order for their Pizza and see the total charge for it.
5. Have an option to order as many pizzas as they want.
6. Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered they should be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
7. If they want their pizza to be delivered, they should be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert 
8. See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
9. On checkout, the application displays the orders’ summary together with the total amount charged. For example, if the customer has made more than one pizza order, 
10. On checkout the application displays a summary of all the orders he/she has made and the total amount to pay for all his/her orders.
